    <div class="contents"><p>The world-famous neon lights of Las Vegas will provide the backdrop to Formula 1â€™s newest race
        when the American city hosts a night event from 2023.

        <p>The Las Vegas Grand Prix will take place on a Saturday next November and be one of three races in the United
        States, joining Miami and Austin.

        <p>Las Vegas hosted races in 1981 and 1982 but this will be the first time F1 cars will race on the iconic Las
        Vegas Strip, with the circuit sweeping past famous hotels and casinos.
        The 14-turn track will run for 3.8 miles (6.12km) with top speeds expected to hit around 212mph (342km/h).

        The design features three straights, a high-speed cornering sequence and a single chicane section, with the
        Grand Prix to be run over 50 laps.

        <p>F1 and Liberty Media will work together to promote the race in partnership with Live Nation Entertainment and
        the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), as well as Founding Partners Caesars Entertainment, MGM
        Resorts International, and Wynn Las Vegas and Presenting Partners MSG Sphere, Resorts World Las Vegas and The
        Venetian Resort.</div>
