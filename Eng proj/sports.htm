    ENGLAND WILL DISCOVER their group stage opponents for the World Cup in Qatar this evening, with Germany or Croatia potentially standing in their way early on.

Gareth Southgate’s men are in the top pot of seeds for today’s draw in Doha, and a rematch against the Germans – who England beat in the last 16 en route to the Euro 2020 final – or World Cup semi-final conquerors Croatia are two possibilities which lie in wait.

Both those sides are in a strong-looking pot two which also includes Mexico, Denmark and Holland.

Scotland, Wales and Ukraine are treated as a single placeholder in the bottom pot of seeds, with the outcome of their play-off path not set to be decided until June following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The pots will be emptied from one to four, with each team assigned to a group and given a number between one and four within that group. Hosts Qatar have already been assigned Group A and position one, and will play in the tournament’s opening game on November 21.
